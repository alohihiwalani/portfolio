            <p>Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. Use your fucking hands. Think about all the fucking possibilities. Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing. Change only occurs when you work deliberately with purpose toward a goal. Fuck. A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space. Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. Design is all about fucking relationships—the relationship of form and content, the relationship of elements, the relationship of designer and user. Design as if your fucking life depended on it. If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing. Someday is not a fucking day of the week. Dedicate yourself to lifelong fucking learning. While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, “When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.” If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else?
